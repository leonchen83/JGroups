== Overview
link:$$http:///jgroups.org$$[JGroups] is a clustering library, allowing members to exchange messages.

It provides the following functionality:

* Joining a given cluster (becoming a member)
* (Once joined), sending messages to other members
* Getting a list of the members in the same cluster
* Registering callbacks that are invoked when
** a message is received
** a member joins
** a member leaves
* Leaving a cluster


== Sample code

The code below shows how to send messages to all cluster members. Open two or more shells and run the demo with
different arguments (names of the members), e.g. `node1`, `node2` etc.

[source,java]
----
public class Demo {
    protected JChannel ch;

    protected void start(String name) throws Exception {
        ch=new JChannel("udp.xml").name(name)
          .setReceiver(new MyReceiver(name))
          .connect("demo-cluster");
        int counter=1;
        for(;;) {
            ch.send(null, "msg-" + counter++);
            Util.sleep(3000);
        }
    }

    protected static class MyReceiver implements Receiver {
        protected final String name;

        protected MyReceiver(String name) {
            this.name=name;
        }

        public void receive(Message msg) {
            System.out.printf("-- [%s] msg from %s: %s\n", name, msg.src(), msg.getObject());
        }

        public void viewAccepted(View v) {
            System.out.printf("-- [%s] new view: %s\n", name, v);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        new Demo().start(args[0]);
    }
}

`JChannel` is the handle to interact with JGroups. In `start()`, a new `JChannel` is created with configuration
`udp.xml` (see <<Configuration>>), which needs to be found on the classpath. Alternatively, a fully qualified
pathname can be given, e.g. `/Users/bela/tcp.xml`.

The receiver is set to an instance of `MyReceiver`, which implements two callbacks: `viewAccepted()`, invoked when a
member joins or leaves, and `receive()`, invoked when a message is received.

Finally, cluster `"demo-cluster"` is joined via `JChannel.connect()`. When this call returns, a member can start
sending and receiving messages.

The main loop sends a message to all cluster members (including itself) at a given interval.

The output of running 3 members `A`, `B` and `C` might look like this:

[listing]
....
-------------------------------------------------------------------
GMS: address=C, cluster=demo-cluster, physical address=192.168.1.106:59093
-------------------------------------------------------------------
-- [C] new view: [A|6] (3) [A, B, C]
-- [C] message from C: msg-1
-- [C] message from A: msg-15
-- [C] message from B: msg-5
-- [C] message from C: msg-2
-- [C] message from A: msg-16
....


[[Configuration]]
== Configuration
A `JChannel` is created from an XML configuration (but can also be created programmatically, see the manual for
details). The configuration contains a list of _protocols_. `JChannel.send(Message msg)` sends a message down the
stack, passing each protocol, and the _transport protocol_ (at the bottom) sends the message.

At the receiver, the transport protocol reads the message and passes it up the stack to the `JChannel`, which
delivers it to the application (the `receive(Message msg)` callback).

A configuration might look as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<config xmlns="urn:org:jgroups"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="urn:org:jgroups http://www.jgroups.org/schema/jgroups.xsd">
    <UDP
         mcast_port="${jgroups.udp.mcast_port:45588}"
         thread_pool.max_threads="200" />
    <PING />
    <MERGE3 max_interval="30000"
            min_interval="10000"/>
    <FD_SOCK2/>
    <FD_ALL3/>
    <VERIFY_SUSPECT2 timeout="1500"  />
    <pbcast.NAKACK2 xmit_interval="500"/>
    <UNICAST3 xmit_interval="500" />
    <pbcast.STABLE desired_avg_gossip="50000"
                   max_bytes="4M"/>
    <pbcast.GMS print_local_addr="true" join_timeout="1000"/>
    <UFC max_credits="4M"
         min_threshold="0.4"/>
    <MFC max_credits="4M"
         min_threshold="0.4"/>
    <FRAG2 frag_size="60K"  />
</config>
----

It essentially contains the list of protocols. In the example above, `UDP` is the transport protocol and
`FRAG2` is the top protocol. Protocols have attributes, which govern the working of a protocol, e.g.
`xmit_interval` in `UNICAST3`, which is the retransmission interval (in milliseconds) of messages, until
they're acknowledged.

The list of protocols defines the _quality of service_ of a given stack, ie. reliable retransmisson, FIFO or
total ordering and so on.

JGroups ships with multiple sample configurations, e.g. `tcp.xml`, which uses TCP instead of UDP as transport
protocol. Consult the manual (link below) for more details.
